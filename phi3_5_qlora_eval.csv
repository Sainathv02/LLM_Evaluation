Can I travel to the US with a criminal record?,Entry may be restricted or require additional documentation.,"
Whether you can travel to the United States with a criminal record depends on the nature of the offense, its severity, and the amount of time that has passed since the conviction.

However, for certain visa categories, a criminal record can be a significant barrier.

Here are some key points to consider:

This assessment is part of the process to determine eligibility for a visa or permanent resident status (green card). If an individual is deemed likely to become a public charge, they may be denied entry or permanent residency. The rule is intended to protect the U.S. immigration system from admitting individuals who might not be able to support themselves without government aid.

What is the difference between a visa waiver and a visa?,A visa waiver allows visa-free travel for eligible countries.,"

A visa is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a non-citizen, allowing them to enter, stay for a specified period, and sometimes work or study.
