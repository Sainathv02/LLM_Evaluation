The response successfully captures the essence of the 'public charge' rule as it pertains to USCIS considerations without straying into unrelated or unsupported information.\\n\\nGiven that the context explicitly states that the 'public charge' rule is about USCIS considering an applicant's likelihood of becoming dependent on government assistance, the response is entirely supported by this information. There is no extraneous information or significant deviations from the provided context. The definition provided is clear, precise, and entirely derived from the given context.\\n\\nTherefore, the response meets the highest standard of the scoring rubric, as all details in the response are directly supported by the context without any hallucinated or fabricated information.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation criteria and scoring rubric, the response deserves the highest score.\",\n",

The context explicitly advises consulting an immigration attorney for specific guidance, which implies that the response should not attempt to provide detailed legal advice. Instead, it offers a concise, general statement that aligns with the context's suggestion to seek professional legal counsel.\\n\\nThe response correctly identifies that divorce can impact visa status during the approval process of a visa petition or application for permanent resident status, leading to potential denial or withdrawal. This information is directly relevant to the question and does not contradict the context. The response avoids providing specific details that would require legal expertise, which is appropriate given the context's emphasis on consulting a professional.\\n\\nThere are no significant deviations or fabrications in the response. It stays within the bounds of the information provided by the context, offering a general statement that accurately reflects the potential consequences of divorce on visa status without overstepping into unsupported territory. The concise nature of the response also aligns well with the context's implication that the information should be general rather than specific.\\n\\nOverall, the response demonstrates a high level of consistency with the provided context, accurately addressing the question while adhering to the guidance to seek professional legal advice.\",\n",

This part of the response is accurate and aligns with the context. However, the omission of the need to go through the US embassy or consulate is a major inconsistency with the provided context. This omission introduces a substantial amount of information that is not supported by the context and could be considered fabricated or hallucinated.\\n\\nGiven that the context suggests the process involves the US embassy or consulate, the response\\'s failure to mention this key aspect means it does not fully adhere to the provided information. The inclusion of the Form I-901 and the fee is plausible but is not explicitly supported by the given context, which makes the response partially consistent but not fully faithful to the context.\\n\\nTherefore, the response is mostly consistent with the provided context but has a significant inconsistency that affects its overall alignment with the context.',\n",

The response does not introduce any significant hallucinated or fabricated information, but it could be more direct to fully align with the context.
