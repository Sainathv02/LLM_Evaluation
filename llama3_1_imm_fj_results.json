It also correctly advises consulting with an immigration professional, which is a prudent suggestion given the complexity of immigration matters. However, the introduction of specific visa types and age-related eligibility criteria (like \"under the age of 21\") is not directly supported by the provided context.\n\nWhile the response does not contain significant hallucinated information, it does introduce details not present in the original context, which prevents it from achieving perfect consistency.
